### OpenDynamic Creator

OpenDynamic is a framework for creating adaptive/dynamic music in games. This tool aids in the creation of project files that can then be imported into a game engine and tied into the built-in audio subsystem. Current development efforts are focused on [Godot Game Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot), but the format should be modular enough to adapt to any engine.

Current icons are temporary and taken from [Open Iconic](https://github.com/iconic/open-iconic).
